## Library Used
msp430.h - default library

## Dependencies
* MSP430 Development board
* CCS coding software

## Set Requirements
"Build "Addressable" RGB LEDs which can be connected in series with one another and can have patterns generated from them. You will need to utilize any development board of your choosing to generate a RGB node. By the week of _**OCTOBER 11**_, you will be expected to come into lab with a fully operational RGB node ready to be connected together. Your node will be tested individually during that lab period, with your documentation (code and readme) being graded throughout the week."
